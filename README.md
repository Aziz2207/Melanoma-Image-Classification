# Melanoma-Image-Classification
Developed a deep learning project for binary classification of skin lesions into benign and malignant categories to assist in melanoma detection. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high-accuracy classification. Key features include: 
- Data Preprocessing: Automated loading, augmentation (random flips, rotations, and zooms), and preprocessing of skin lesion images to improve model generalization.
- Model Architecture: Designed and implemented a CNN with batch normalization and dropout layers to enhance stability and prevent overfitting.
- Training and Evaluation: Used TensorFlow/Keras for model training and validation, plotted learning curves, and evaluated performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.
- Visualization: Displayed predictions, confusion matrix (normalized and non-normalized), and performance metrics through detailed plots.
- Technologies used: TensorFlow/Keras, Python, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
